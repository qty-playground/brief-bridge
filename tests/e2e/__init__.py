# E2E (End-to-End) Tests
# 
# This directory contains comprehensive tests that verify the entire system
# from Web API endpoints through to the underlying business logic.
# 
# Unlike unit tests that test individual components or BDD tests that test
# use cases directly, E2E tests simulate real user interactions through
# HTTP requests to ensure the complete request-response cycle works correctly.
