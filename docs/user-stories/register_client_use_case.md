# Register Client Use Case

## Business Context
The RegisterClientUseCase is responsible for handling client registration in the Brief Bridge system. This use case manages the business logic of registering new clients and handling re-registration scenarios at the application layer level.

## Use Case Specification
- **Use Case**: RegisterClientUseCase.execute_client_registration()
- **Input**: ClientRegistrationRequest(client_id, client_name)
- **Output**: ClientRegistrationResponse(client_id, client_name, client_status, registration_successful, registration_message)
- **Dependencies**: ClientRepository interface

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario: Register new client successfully
```
Given no client exists with id "new-client-001"
When I execute client registration with:
  - client_id: "new-client-001"
  - client_name: "Test Client Alpha"
Then registration should be successful
And registration response should contain:
  - client_id: "new-client-001"
  - client_name: "Test Client Alpha"
  - client_status: "online"
  - registration_successful: true
  - registration_message: "Client registered successfully"
And client should be saved in repository with:
  - client_id: "new-client-001"
  - name: "Test Client Alpha"
  - status: "online"
```

### Scenario: Register client with minimal information
```
Given no client exists with id "minimal-client"
When I execute client registration with:
  - client_id: "minimal-client"
  - client_name: null
Then registration should be successful
And registration response should contain:
  - client_id: "minimal-client"
  - client_name: null
  - client_status: "online"
  - registration_successful: true
And client should be saved in repository with:
  - client_id: "minimal-client"
  - name: null
  - status: "online"
```

### Scenario: Register client with empty client_id
```
Given no preconditions
When I execute client registration with:
  - client_id: ""
  - client_name: "Invalid Client"
Then registration should fail
And registration response should contain:
  - registration_successful: false
  - registration_message: "Client ID cannot be empty"
And no client should be saved in repository
```

## Business Rules Validation
- **client.registration**: New clients are created with "online" status
- **client.identity**: Each client must have a non-empty client_id
- **client.name_optional**: Client name is optional (can be null)
- **repository.persistence**: All registered clients must be persisted via repository

## Reusable Step Definitions

### Given Steps
- `Given no client exists with id "{client_id}"`
- `Given no preconditions`

### When Steps
- `When I execute client registration with: {request_properties}`

### Then Steps
- `Then registration should be successful`
- `Then registration should fail`
- `Then registration response should contain: {response_properties}`
- `Then client should be saved in repository with: {client_properties}`
- `Then no client should be saved in repository`

## Implementation Notes
- This use case tests business logic only, not web framework integration
- Focus is on ClientRegistrationRequest → RegisterClientUseCase → ClientRegistrationResponse flow
- Repository interactions are tested through interface, not specific implementation
- Error handling focuses on business rule violations, not HTTP errors
